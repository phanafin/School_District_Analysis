### School_District_Analysis
##Module 4 School Data Analysis

#**Overview**
The purpose of this analysis was to recover District Testing Data rendered inaccurate due to inaccurate reporting of 9th Grade Data out of Thomas High School.  

#**Analysis**
The number of students in the 9th Grade at Thomas High School is 461.  The total number of students in the District is 39,170.  The fact that the data relating to the 9th graders at Thomas High School was reported inaccurately had an impact on the overall scoring results, even though the Freshmen at Thomas only make up little more that 1% of the total population.
#**Results**
  1. How is the district summary affected?
    The district was affected by the changes in a variety of ways.  Essentially, all averages changed as a result of the 9th grade data being renendered Null. The Top 5 Schools list dramatically changed as Thomas High School fell out of that designation.
      
  2. How is the school summary affected?
    As the data was taken out for the 9th graders, the overall sample size for Thomas High School decreased.  The reduction of students led to changes in the averages in both Math and Reading.  Therefore, their impact on the district as a whole changed, and not for the better.
    
  3. How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
    The 9th grade scores were inflated which produced better results and increased their standing among the district.  With those scores taken out, the averages decreased across the board and therefore not only decreased Thomas High School standing within the district, but also affected the total averages among the other high schools which lead to their outcomes and rankings being altered.
    
  6. How does replacing the nonth-grade scores affect the following:
      a.) Math and reading scores by grade
      b.) Scores by school spending
      c.) Scores by school size
      d.) Scores by school type
