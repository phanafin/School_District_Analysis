### School_District_Analysis

##Module 4 School Data Analysis

#**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis was to recover District Testing Data rendered inaccurate due to inaccurate reporting of 9th Grade Data out of Thomas High School.  

#**Analysis**

The number of students in the 9th Grade at Thomas High School is 461.  The total number of students in the District is 39,170.  The fact that the data relating to the 9th graders at Thomas High School was reported inaccurately had an impact on the overall scoring results, even though the Freshmen at Thomas only make up little more that 1% of the total population.

#**Results**

  The 7 district metrics that were affected by the data changes are as follows;
  
    1. The Total Students were 39170 and decreased to 38709 as a result of taking the Thomas High School Freshmen out of the data totals. This reduction of student population has an impact on all but one of the other metrics, albeit a small one.
    2. Total Budget has remained the same, but the spending per student has changed with the reduction of the 9th graders from Thomas HS.  This is a bit of a misnomer and probably shouldn't be taken into consideration as the dollars have been spent and the 9th graders from Thomas HS we in fact educated.
    3. The Average Math Score was essentially unchanged (78.9) the changes were fractional at best.
    4. Average Reading Scores also only changed fracionally and essentially remained at 81.9.
    5. The Percentage of Students Passing Math went down with the reduction of student population.  Before the students were removed, the percentage was 74.98, and after the percentage changed to 74.8%.  The move was fractional as well, but does denote a change in performance.
    6. The Percentage of Students Passing Reading also reduced a bit.  The percentage went from 85.81% to 85.7%.
    7. Considering the reduction of the two previous items, it follows that OveraLL Passing Percentage also was reduced fractionally.  The score was 65.17% before the students were taken out and 64.9% without the 9th graders from Thomas HS.

#**Summary**

One main area of difference between the original data and the adjusted data is that Thomas High School has lost it's status as a top 5 performing High School. Thomas High School was considered the second best performing High School in the District until the number were adjusted.
An item that should be taken seriously and perhaps investigated (outside of the apparent fraud perpetrated by Thomas High School) is the fact that the data shows that as per student spending increases, Overall Passing Percentage decreases which lends to the arguement that increased school spending does not lead to increased student performance.  Perhaps the district should evaluate their effectiveness and become more efficient .
